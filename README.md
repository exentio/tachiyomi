# ![app icon](./.github/readme-images/app-icon.png)Tachiyomi (Controversial)
Tachiyomi is a free and open source manga reader for Android 6.0 and above. This is a (somehow controversial) fork that restores shorter update frequencies like 3, 4, and 6 hours.  

I won't add or change any feature that isn't directly related to having more frequent updates, nor will I fix any bug that wasn't directly caused by my changes, issues are disabled to discourage this.  

Don't bother the original devs with any issue caused by my fork ~~(especially since they don't respect their own code of conduct)~~, nor bother me for making this fork or ask me to start a war with them or an hard fork or whatever: I will laugh out loudly for about 5 seconds then ignore you.  

I don't use Discord, use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Exentiostep) for any questions and bug reports (no I won't open my DMs).  

No I won't put [the Hakase ip meme](https://twitter.com/Exentiostep/status/1492459356021043200/photo/4) on the splashscreen.
